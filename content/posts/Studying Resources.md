This is a list of useful resources for myself when studying.

As you may or may not have gathered, I mainly study medicine. Outside of medicine, I don't really study anything else and just embark on random writing projects and ramblings.


## General Resources {#general-resources}


### Anki {#anki}

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a great flashcard application. I can reliably trust that if I do my cards regularly, whatever flashcards I make for Anki will eventually get memorised. It remains my main way of studying. Cards I get wrong, I tend to review the topic until I am able to understand the card again.

Here are all the addons I find useful although noting that I have more addons as well.

-   A New Card Counter Speed vs Retention Forecast Graphs

### Obsidian {#obsidian}

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is an okay electron based markdown editor for note taking. My primary reason for using it over other text editors such as Emacs is its mobile and cross platform support. Mobile support remains crucial for me because, the main time I reference my notes is while at work so I wanted a more fully featured application to view my notes on mobile as opposed to using Emacs within Termux on Android. I do occasionally use Emacs to edit my markdown files in my obsidian vault using [obsidian.el](https://github.com/licht1stein/obsidian.el).

My notes are hosted onto a website using netlify ([https://junior-doctor-notes.netlify.app/](https://junior-doctor-notes.netlify.app/)) which makes it easy to access my notes for reference on any computer while at work. In addition, if I ever want to edit my notes while at work, I could do so by logging into github and editing the repository to which they are hosted with github's native markdown editor. Although it lacks all the features, it gets the job done.

Here are all the obsidian extensions I use:

-   Advanced Tables
-   Auto Link Title
-   Code Editor Shortcuts
-   Dataview
-   Dataview serializer
-   Excalidraw
-   File Hider
-   Footnote Shortcut
-   Git
-   Notebook Navigator
-   Obsidian_to_Anki
-   Omnisearch
-   Past URL into selection
-   Recent Files
-   Smart Typography
-   Text Extractor
-   Update modified date
-   Vim Yank Highlight
-   Vimium
-   Vimrc Support
-   Zotero Integration


### Zotero {#zotero}

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a reference manager. I mainly use it to store my textbooks and read from. I use the better bibtex extension to ensure I always have an updated .bib file to use across my applications. I also use the zotmove extension to move selected entries to my google drive or a directory with syncthing to ensure my textbooks and papers are readable on different platforms.


### Calibre {#calibre}

I use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download) on my macos computer to manage my books (e.g. fiction and non-fiction books). I don't use it for textbooks and research papers (this goes to zotero; see above).


### KOreader {#koreader}

[KOreader](https://koreader.rocks/) is probably the best way to read epubs on my phone. I also use KOreader (and pretty much only KOreader) on my jailbroken kindle with great success.
